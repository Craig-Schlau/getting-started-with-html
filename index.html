<h1>Important Concepts From "The Basics of the Web and HTML"</h1>

<b>Major Components of the Web</b>
<p>The Browser - A program that runs on your computer to display files from the web.
<p>
The Internet - The world's largest computer network</p>

<p>HTTP - The main protocol of the Web</p>
<p>Servers - Computers that hosts the files that make up the Web.</p>


<b>HTML</b>
<p>HTML stands for <em>Hypertext Markup Language.</em> HTML is the main type of documentation on the web.</p>
<p>HTML is made up of:
  <br>
<u>Text Content</u> (what you see)
  <br>
<u>Markup</u> (what it looks like)
  <br>
<u>References to other documents</u> (ex. images and videos)
  <br>
<u>Links to other pages</u>
  <br>

<b>Basic HTML Vocabulary</b>
<p><u>Tag</u> - An HTML tag is always contained within angled brackets. Most tags have an opening bracket and a closing bracket.  However, some tags (void tags) do not require a closing bracket.</p>
<p><u>Element</u> - An HTML element refers to everything within a set of opening and closing tags.</p>
<p><u>Attribute</u> - An attribute is a property of an HTML element.  An example is using href to reference a URL.</p>

<b>Inline vs Block Elements</b>
<p>HTML elements are either <b>inline</b> or <b>block</b>. Block
  elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of
  them.

<b>Five Things to Take Away From This Lesson</b>
<p>1)  What is a webpage?
  <br>
    A webpage is a text document written in a language called HTML.  Web browsers read these documents and then interpret and display them.
</p>
<p>2)  How Coding Works
  <br>
    Coding happens when programmers write text in a language that a computer can understand.  The computer can then follow the instructions the programmer wrote.
</p>
<p>3) Computers are stupid.
  <br>
    Programmers need to write exactly the way a computer understands (also known as writing with correct "syntax").
</p>
<p>4) Programmers can't remember everything.
  <br>
  There are too many details to remember everything.  Programmers can always look up how to write some code.
